Twitter WeRateDogs Analysis
Actually all the information we want can be collected by using tweepy library. 

Data Gathering

For this project, before we start our data analysis travel, we have already got the twitter-archive-enhanced.csv 
and image-prediction-mhl.csv. However, the information is not enough, therefore, we use tweepy to collect the 
remaing necessary part, i.e., tweet_json.txt. Then we extract what we want from tweet_json.txt and create the 
dog_rates_add.csv

Bingo, the data is ready, i.e., twitter-archive-enhanced.csv, image-prediction-mhl.csv, dog_rates_add.csv.

Data Assessing and cleanning
we get the dog_rates_clean.csv after the whole processing.
