This is one loan data set, it takes me huge time to understand each variable, 
which includes understand the variables based on excel data description, search
the related knowledge of credit loan and Prosper WebBank etc.

Then i try to explore the data by Univariate Plot and Bivariate Plot, begin to
know what i can find based on the data. BorrowerAPR, yes, that’s what borrower 
and lender most care about. For borrowers, they want to know how can reduce the
Borrower APR; For lenders, they want to know, what kind of loan will help them 
make lots of money and minimize their loss. I find lots of information in 
Bivariate Plot part. When the correlation matrix is calculated, i compare the 
value with the plot and finally totally understand what’s going on here.
